Create a modern, fast-loading portfolio website using **React + Tailwind CSS + Vite**.

The design should be inspired by the Spotlight Tailwind UI template: https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight/preview

🔧 **Core Features:**
- Fully responsive layout
- Light/Dark mode toggle using Tailwind’s `dark` class and `useState`
- Smooth, lightweight scroll and hover animations (Framer Motion)
- Google Fonts: `Inter` for body, `Poppins` for headings
- Deployed-ready via Vite (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`)

🧑‍💻 **Hero Section:**
- Name: “Muma Kalobwe”
- Subtitle: “Full Stack Developer | Data & AI Enthusiast | FinTech-Focused”
- Centered on screen with animated entrance
- Toggle button for light/dark mode in top-right

---

🧠 **About Section:**
- Heading: “About Me”
- Paragraph: “I’m a full-stack developer with a background in psychology & criminology, now building smart solutions in fintech, fraud detection, and AI-powered tooling. I thrive at the intersection of behavioral insight and clean, scalable code.”

📁 **Projects Section:**
- Heading: “Featured Projects”
- A responsive grid of cards (2 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
- Each card includes:
  - Project icon (SVG or PNG on the left)
  - Project name as heading
  - Short description
  - "View Live ↗" link
- Add these 5 projects (all cards must animate in on scroll):
